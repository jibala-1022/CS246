Task 3
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'History of Contemporary India' for key 'hss_table02.PRIMARY'
That is cname was primary so duplicate values threw error,

Task 4
NO ERROR
Since the primary key tuple (roll_number, cid) will be unique for a record, there are no duplicates.

Task 5
ERROR 1068 (42000): Multiple primary key defined
Primary key set is a tuple that uniquely defines a record. But initializing different keys can cause primary keys to be unique but still tuples to be duplicates.
For eg: in future a new record with sno = 1441 and roll_number = 170101001 will be considered duplicate since roll_number is duplicated. But as a tuple, this record is unique.
To avoid this, primary keys are stored in tuples.
Hence the table is not created.

Task 6
ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`week04`.`hss_table05`, CONSTRAINT `hss_table05_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`cid`) REFERENCES `hss_course01` (`cid`))
There is a value in the referencing table (hss_table05) that does not exist in the referenced table (hss_course01).
For eg: In the last record of hss_table05 cname - 'Introduction to Archaeology' but it does not exist in hss_course01.
